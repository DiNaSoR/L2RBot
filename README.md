# L2RBot

Original project at https://github.com/woody34/L2RBot

Lineage 2 Revolution Pixel Bot

I am currently refactoring the bot to work with the US release of the game, specifically v1.x.

I have tested the following features and I am mostly satisfied with their consistant performance:
Weekly Quest

I have tested the following and they are working but not quite as desired:
Main Quest,
Scroll Quest

The following are features that are still being refactored.
Daily Dungeon
Tower of Insoloence
Alter of Darkness(I will get this to where I can have a quick feature release once Rifts are release into the game)

This bot is configured to use NoxPlayer to emulate Android on your PC. It has been tested with Nox Player v5.0-v6.0. 

I am open to feedback, if you would like a feature added or changed let me know!
