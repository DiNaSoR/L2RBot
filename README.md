# L2RBot

Lineage 2 Revolution Pixel Bot International v0.18 Compatible (working on compatibility for US release v1.x)

This bot is configured to use NoxPlayer to emulate Android on your PC. It has been tested with Nox Player v5.1. If you are using a different android emulator you should be able to change the following to get it working. I will be adding additional functionality into the settings tab of the MainWindow in the future to make this easier.

1. Screen.cs - change the pixel measurements for the  4 boards to match your emulator.
2. Bot.BindNoxPlayer - edit the emulator string value to match your emulators .ProcessName
3. Nox player/Emulator- resolution set to 1280x720.
